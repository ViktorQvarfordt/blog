What is a 10x engineer? Being guided impact and curiosity.

Are you looking to keep growing as an engineer? Here are my recommendations. And book tips in the comments.

1️⃣  IMPACT 🎯

Understanding business and organizational impact is essential, otherwise you risk writing code has low value. Talk to your PMs, tech leads and other stakeholders to get an understanding of what matters and why.

2️⃣ CURIOSITY 💡

Make sure you work on what gives you joy. Otherwise you will quickly get drained. Staying curious is important for keeping up with the ever-changing landscape of tools and technologies.

3️⃣ EXPERIMENTATION 🔬

Get used to building prototypes and quickly setting up new projects for experimentation. Minimize time between idea to code to execution. The half-life of knowledge for tools and frameworks is very low. Accept this and keep experimenting. In contrast, the half-life of fundamental skills is very high. Get really good at the fundamentals and the rest comes easier.

4️⃣ FUNDAMENTALS ✅

- Data modeling
  - Normalized vs. denormalized data relations
  - Data structures (maps, sets, queues, trees, ...)
  - Type systems and type patterns such as discriminated unions types
  - Inheritance vs. composition
  - State management (databases, SQL, caching, ...)
- Concepts from functional programming; pure functions and immutable data
- Read the documentation in detail of the tools that are essential to you
- Mentally execute code; in this way you can consume documentation quickly
- Fundamentals of the web; understand what is "under" the frameworks
  - HTTP (how it looks without the abstraction of frameworks)
  - DOM (familiarize with the DOM APIs - browsers are amazing)
  - Use MDN as your reference manual

5️⃣ COMMUNITY 👥

Engineering is not a solitary activity, it builds on the efforts of the engineering community. Talk to other engineers in your organization, outside your organization, and engage in open source projects that interest you.

6️⃣ BOOTSTRAP VIA EXPERTS 🧩

Talking to experts directly allows you to gain knowledge much faster than trying to become an expert yourself. What you learn from an expert in 1h can replace days if not weeks of research. Remove mental barriers for reaching out to experts, experts love to talk about their area of expertise. They don't care about how much you know, they care about how curious you are.

7️⃣ AUGMENT YOURSELF 🤖

Let copilot and LLMs write code for you. These tools are very good and help you move faster when you use them right. Good use case include writing a comment for the function you need and let copilot generate for you, and use ChatGPT to review your code to find improvements. You must have a sense of what good looks like and never blindly copy code.

8️⃣ SIMPLICITY AND ELEGANCE 🍃

"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction."

Be happy. Look for solutions.
